# Poly Schema

The dead simple schema builder. See the [docs](https://nathan-pham.github.io/poly-schema/the-poly-schema/1.0.2/).

Hold up. Why is this useful? I've finally come up with an idea! This is really good for defining datastructures and simple form validation, without having to have a bunch of if statements. I'm currently rewriting the codebase to TypeScript.

## Installation

```
>>> npm install the-poly-schema
```

```
import PolySchema, { PolyTypes } from "the-poly-schema";
```
